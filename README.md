# CV Application

In this small web application, users can create a resume based on a predefined template by simply filling in the required form fields. The application allows full flexibility when building the resume — users can customize each section freely or leave certain sections empty, in which case they will not be included in the final output.

Additional customization options include selecting fonts and colors to better match personal preferences. The application provides a live preview of the resume as it is being built, making it easy to see changes instantly.

Once the user is satisfied with the result, the resume can be printed directly from the browser or downloaded as a PDF for sharing or further use.
